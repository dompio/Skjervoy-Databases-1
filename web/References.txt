The our-pens, our-notebooks, and our-locations pages contain parts from the free Selling template by Colorlib. The template is available via colorlib.com/wp/template/selling. 
Specifically, we reused the Products section and adapted it to showcase our pens and notebooks, as well as the Featured Products sections to display our stores. 
All the files in ../web/css/, ../web/scss/, ../web/fonts/, and ../web/js/ folders are copied from this template, with modifications made to CSS. 

The footer is based on the Codepen public template available via codepen.io/digitalavinash/pen/VjGGgp. We reused mostly the CSS which was appended to the ../web/style.css file. 

For nav bar, search bar, and buttons we used Bootstrap libraries and modified them to match the initial designs.
